# AoC 2021 Solutions in Rust

Most solutions are decently fast but there are some optimization opportunities:
- Day 7: The solution space for part 2 could be reduced thanks to some math. 
  However, it already runs so fast I don't think it's worth it.
- Day 19: This uses a sort-of brute-force solution. I could reduce the search
  and make it faster by a significant amount if I e.g. sorted by pairwise
  distance between beacons. Currently runs in about 11.8 seconds on my MacBook
  Pro.
- Day 22: This is the slowest of the bunch. This compresses the space by only
  using grid indices that show up in the inputs, but that still takes ~40
  seconds and ~15GB of memory on my MacBook Pro. There should be a solution
  using the [inclusion-exclusion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusionâ€“exclusion_principle)
  which would solve this in a much shorter amount of time and with less memory.
- Day 23: The solution takes ~3s for part 1 and doesn't complete for part 2,
  since it runs out of memory on my system, so I will be working on
  optimizing that right now (to get my star)
